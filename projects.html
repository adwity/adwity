				<h4>Alfred Automated</h4>
				<h4 class="subheading">An automated drink delivery robot.</h4>
				<p class="text-muted">
					For my final year capstone project me and my team developed a drink delivery robot that received instructions from a website to navigate within an office layout, plan paths and deliver drinks.<br>
					I was responsible for sending and receiving information to and from the robot. Instructions from the website were sent as an Integer Array and was received by the Bluetooth module attached to Alfred.<br>
					Based on the instructions received, Alfred choses the direction and distance of movement.<br>
					The robot was also able to detect obstacles and inform the server to receive information about rerouting.

				<h4>Ping Pong</h4>
				<h4 class="subheading">Redeveloped a classic ping pong game.</h4>
				<p class="text-muted">For this academic project I worked in a group of three people to redesign and redevelop a simple ping pong game.<br> 
				We enforced the MVC model for the game.<br> 
				We added innovative twists such as various speed levels and a new game with one extra ball mode, where the user had to avoid hitting one of the balls. In addition, we also added a multiplayer layer that allowed two people to play the game at the same time.</p>
